# ExperimentManager State Machine Summary

## State Definitions

- IDLE
  System is initialized and waiting for user command.
  - Transitions:
    - on "StartExperiment" -> CONFIGURING

- CONFIGURING
  Node configures local parameters (waveform, force sample rate, etc.)
  - Transitions:
    - on configuration complete -> READY

- READY
  System is configured and waiting for external "GO" signal
  - Transitions:
    - on "StartRun" -> RUNNING

- RUNNING
  System is actively executing the experiment
  - Transitions:
    - on experiment complete -> FINISHED
    - on "Abort" -> ERROR

- FINISHED
  System returns to IDLE after optional cleanup/logging

- ERROR
  Entered on any fault or user-issued Abort
  - Transitions:

## Notes:
- ExperimentManager should issue all state transition messages through CommClient's publish method using topic: `<node>/status`
- Callbacks from CommClient (e.g., incoming /cmd) trigger transitions when appropriate
